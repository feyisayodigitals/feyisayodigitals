- 👋 Hi, I’m @feyisayodigitals
- 👀 I’m interested in learning laravel, javascript and sql.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a wide variety of inquiries including questions about Git and GitHub workflows, GitHub Pages, API, and other desktop applications. I works closely with software engineering team to test, track down bugs and improve on documentation.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with software developers in testing codes they have written on staging servers before being deployed to production and live servers. I have excellent writing skills and charming written personality, and the ability to simplify complicated things by the way clients are oriented and wired. I measure my success in swiftness, accuracy, and clarity.
